# View Controller Transitions

Prior to iOS7, transitions between view controllers was not supported by SDK and we were able to create those transitions via custom UIViewAnimations. Beside this, making those transitions interactive was another painful task.

Now we have a nice API for controlling the animation between view controllers. The API heavily consists of delegate pattern and protocols. The generic work principle of the new API can be explained as:

![Transitiong API][schema_td]

* When you present a view controller, UIKit looks for the [transitioningDelegate][id_td] for that View Controller.
* If that delegate is not empty, UIKit retrieves the animation controller, which is responsible for the transition between view controllers. [transitioningDelegate][id_td] methods look like this:

```
-(id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)
			animationControllerForPresentedController:(UIViewController *)presented
 			presentingController:(UIViewController *)presenting 
			sourceController:(UIViewController *)source
```

```
-(id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)
			animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed
```

* Those animation controllers which conform `<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>` protocol are the ones we will use for the custom transitions. To conform `<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>` protocol, animation controllers should implement the following methods:

```
-(NSTimeInterval)transitionDuration:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
```

```
-(void)animateTransition:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
```

* The key point here; UIKit sends to our animation controller a `transitionContext` object, in which we can find any information about the transition to happen. We are going to use `transitionContext` object to fetch views of both presenting and presented view controllers, calculating final frames, managing lifecycle of transtiion etc. For more details see [transitionContext][id_tc].


### Working Example
-

We will implement this complicated and protocol oriented API, by creating a simple fadein-fadeout transition between 2 view controllers.
Let's assume we have 2 view controllers, **HomeViewController** and **FadeViewController** respectively.

For simplicity, **HomeViewController** would present a **FadeViewController** instance. Nothing new here except the [transitioningDelegate][id_td]:

```
	UIViewController *fade = [[UIStoryboard storyboardWithName:@"Main" bundle:nil] instantiateViewControllerWithIdentifier:@"fade"];
   fade.transitioningDelegate = fade;
   [self presentViewController:fade animated:YES completion:nil];

```

After this step we will implement this delegate in **FadeViewController** :

```
@interface FadeViewController : UIViewController <UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate>

@property (nonatomic,strong) IBOutlet id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning> presentAnimationController;

@end



@implementation FadeViewController

.
.
.

-(id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>) 
				animationControllerForPresentedController:(UIViewController *)presented 
				presentingController:(UIViewController *)presenting 
				sourceController:(UIViewController *)source
{
    return self.presentAnimationController;
}

-(id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>) animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed
{
    return nil;
}

@end

```

UIKit asks our transitionDelegate, which is **FadeViewController** in our case, whether there is an animationController for preseting this voew controller. We return `self.presentAnimationController` for presenting transition, and `nil` for dismissing transition. We do not want to have any custom transition while dismissing **FadeViewController**.

But what is the `self.presentAnimationController` property? Where is it initialized? 

Actually the property `self.presentAnimationController` is marked as `IBOutlet`. This means we can specify that property from **Storyboard** or **Interface Builder**.

First we create our animation controller. Here is the controller **FadeTransition.h**:

```
@interface FadeTransition : NSObject  <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>

@end

```

Note that **FadeTransition** class conforms `<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>` which is a requirement to be an animation controller. Finally  **FadeTransition.m**:


```
@implementation FadeTransition

-(NSTimeInterval)transitionDuration:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
{
    return 3.0;
}

-(void)animateTransition:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
{
    UIViewController *source = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey];
    UIViewController *target = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey];
    
    UIView *containerView = [transitionContext containerView];
    
    CGRect finalFrame     = [transitionContext finalFrameForViewController:target];
    
    target.view.frame = finalFrame;
    target.view.alpha = 0.0f;
    [containerView addSubview:target.view];
    
    [UIView animateWithDuration:[self transitionDuration:transitionContext]
                     animations:^{
                         source.view.alpha = 1.0f;
                         target.view.alpha = 1.0f;
                     }
                     completion:^(BOOL finished) {
                         [transitionContext completeTransition:YES];
                     }];
}

@end

```

As i told before, UIKit send `(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>) transitionContext` object to our **FadeTransition** object, therefore we are able to fetch the necessary metadata for the transition. Lets cover it step by step. First we get the 2 views of view controllers:

```
UIViewController *source = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey];
UIViewController *target = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey];
```

Then we get the `containerView`, which was created by UIKit itself temporarily.

```
UIView *containerView = [transitionContext containerView];

```

 `containerView` is active and being displayed during the transition. As soon as we **finish** or **cancel** the transition, `containerView` is destroyed by UIKit. We can think `containerView` as a scene, in which we play any animation we want, and close the scene when the transition ends.
 
```
[UIView animateWithDuration:[self transitionDuration:transitionContext]
                     animations:^{
                         source.view.alpha = 1.0f;
                         target.view.alpha = 1.0f;
                     }
                     completion:^(BOOL finished) {
                         [transitionContext completeTransition:YES];
                     }];
```

This rest of code is just a normal UIViewAnimation. 

The only critical point is here, when we call `[transitionContext completeTransition:YES]`,
we tell UIKit that our transition ended. Within that call, UIKit calls the necessary lifecycle methods on both view controllers such as `-viewDidDisappear:` on **HomeViewController**, and `-viewDidAppear:` on **FadeViewController**. 

Here is how i specify the **FadeTransition** object in **Storyboard**:


![FadeTransition](storyboard_1.png)








--
This is how it looks for presenting with **FadeTransition**:

![FadeTransition](fade_3.gif)

Here comes the interesting part. We will use the same transition to dismiss the **FadeViewController**. 

First we create another animation controller for dismiss transition:

``` objectivec 

@interface FadeViewController : UIViewController <UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate>
.
.
.
@property (nonatomic,strong) IBOutlet id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning> dismissAnimationController;

@end

```

And return this animationController for dismissal:

``` 
@implementation FadeViewController

.
.
.
.

-(id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed
{
    return self.dismissAnimationController;
}

@end

```

Finally, we attach the new `self.dismissAnimationController ` in **Storyboard**.

![Dismiss Controller](storyboard_2.png)


We can create different type of animation controllers and switch them in **Storyboard**, to see the transition immediately. Here is a couple of transition effects used in the [sample project][github_project].


![Dismiss Controller](sample_1.gif)


# Interactive Transitions
--

We created different type of transitions for both presenting and dismissing a view controller. What about we want to control the transition with user interaction ? Check the following transition:

![Interactive Transition](sample_4.gif)


The presenting animation controller is the one we used in the previous example, **FadeTransition**. Therefore we can skip the presenting part.

For dismiss transition, we have complicated things a bit. Here is the target view controller called **PiecesViewController**:

```
@interface PiecesViewController : UIViewController <UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate>

@property (nonatomic,strong) IBOutlet id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning> presentingTransitionDelegate;
@property (nonatomic,strong) IBOutlet id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning> dismissingTransitionDelegate;

@end

```

First, we have our ordinary presenting and dismissing animation controllers. Note that we already set the `id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning> presentingTransitionDelegate` to **FadeTransition** in **Storyboard**.


The dismiss transition however, we choose to set it in code, in `-viewDidLoad` method:

```
@implementation PiecesViewController

-(void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    PiecesTransition *transition = [PiecesTransition new];
    self.dismissingAnimationController = transition;
}

.
.
.
.


-(id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animationControllerForDismissedController:(UIViewController *)dismissed
{
    return self.dismissingAnimationController;
}


@end

```

Lets look at the `PiecesTransition` class. First the interface:

```
@interface PiecesTransition : NSObject <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>

@end

```

and implementation:

```
@implementation PiecesTransition


-(NSTimeInterval)transitionDuration:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
{
    return 0.7;
}

-(void)animateTransition:(id<UIViewControllerContextTransitioning>)transitionContext
{
    PiecesViewController *source = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextFromViewControllerKey];
    UIViewController *target = [transitionContext viewControllerForKey:UITransitionContextToViewControllerKey];
    
    UIView *containerView = [transitionContext containerView];
    
    UIView *view1 = [source.view viewWithTag:1];
    UIView *view2 = [source.view viewWithTag:2];
    UIView *view3 = [source.view viewWithTag:3];
    UIView *view4 = [source.view viewWithTag:4];
    
    NSArray *views  = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:view1,view2,view3,view4, nil];
    
    CGFloat distance = 140.0;
    
    NSArray *targetFrames = [NSArray arrayWithObjects:[NSValue valueWithCGRect:CGRectOffset(view1.frame, -distance, -distance)],
                       [NSValue valueWithCGRect:CGRectOffset(view2.frame, distance, -distance)],
                       [NSValue valueWithCGRect:CGRectOffset(view3.frame, -distance, distance)],
                       [NSValue valueWithCGRect:CGRectOffset(view4.frame, distance, distance)],nil];
    
    
    [containerView insertSubview:target.view belowSubview:source.view];
    
    [UIView animateWithDuration:[self transitionDuration:transitionContext]
                          delay:0.0
                        options:UIViewAnimationOptionCurveEaseIn
                     animations:^{
                         
                         for (NSInteger index = 0; index < views.count; index++) {
                             
                             UIView *view = views[index];
                             CGRect frame = [targetFrames[index] CGRectValue];
                             view.frame = frame;
                         }
                         
                         source.view.alpha = 0.0f;
                         
                     } completion:^(BOOL finished) {
                         
                         if (![transitionContext transitionWasCancelled]) {
                            [source.view removeFromSuperview];
                            [transitionContext completeTransition:YES];
                         }
                         else
                         {
                             [target.view removeFromSuperview];
                             [transitionContext completeTransition:NO];
                         }
                         
                     }];
}

@end

```

Let's discuss the code above in parts. 

* First we will get the views of view controllers as always. We also know that the source view controller is a **PiecesViewController**, therefore we will get the coloured views with their tags.

* After that we calculate the frames for each subview and animate to their final position
* When the animation finishes, we call **completeTransition:** to inform UIKit to complete the lifecycle of the view controller.


When we build and run the project, we will see the new **PieceTransition**, but we immediately aware of that the transition is not interactive. We can only dismiss the view controller by clicking **<< Dismiss** button down.

### Making the transition interactive

We have the dismiss transition working, but we also want to manage the transition via users interactions such as tap, swipe etc.
In our example we will try to manage the transition with **Pan** gesture. 

First we should tell UIKit that this view controller has an interactionController. This is done by overriding the transitionDelegate method in **PiecesViewController**:

```
-(id<UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>)interactionControllerForDismissal:
												(id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animator
```


Here is the view controller implementation:

```
@interface PiecesViewController : UIViewController <UIViewControllerTransitioningDelegate, UINavigationControllerDelegate>

@property (nonatomic,strong) IBOutlet id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning> presentingAnimationController;
@property (nonatomic,strong) IBOutlet id <UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning> dismissingAnimationController;

// new interaction controller
@property (nonatomic,strong) id <UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning> dismissingInteractionController;

@end



@implementation PiecesViewController

.
.
.
.

-(id<UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>)interactionControllerForDismissal:(id<UIViewControllerAnimatedTransitioning>)animator
{
    return dismissingInteractionController;
}

@end
```

 Note that the property `dismissingInteractionController ` conforms the protocol `<UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>`.
 
 Now we need to create that interactionController, here is **PiecesInteraction**:
 
 ```
@interface PiecesInteraction : UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition

@property (nonatomic,weak) UIViewController *viewController;
@property (nonatomic,strong) NSValue *initialPoint;

-(void)setupViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController;

@end

 ```

`PiecesInteraction` object inherits from `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` which conforms `<UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>` behind the scene. Therefore any instances of `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` can be used as an interaction controller.

The interaction controllers will manage the transition with the **Pan** gesture. We might first catch those gestures:

```
@implementation PiecesInteraction

-(void)setupViewController:(UIViewController *)viewController
{
    UIPanGestureRecognizer *gesture = [[UIPanGestureRecognizer alloc] initWithTarget:self
                                                                              action:@selector(pan:)];
    
    [viewController.view addGestureRecognizer:gesture];
    self.viewController = viewController;
    
}

-(void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gesture
{
    
    switch (gesture.state) {
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan;
            break;
            
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged:
            
            break;
            
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded:
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateCancelled:
            
            break;
            
        default:
        
            break;
    }
}
```

We are listening for pan gestures of the view controller. We need to call `-(void)setupViewController:` :

```
@implementation PiecesViewController

-(void)viewDidLoad
{
    [super viewDidLoad];
    
    .
    .
    .
    
    for (UIGestureRecognizer *gesture  in [self.view gestureRecognizers]) {
        [self.view removeGestureRecognizer:gesture];
    }
     
    PiecesInteraction *interaction = [PiecesInteraction new];
    [interaction setupViewController:self];
    self.dismissingInteractionController = interaction;
}
.
.
.
@end

```

In the code above, we initialised an instance of `PiecesInteraction`, set the pan gesture for the view controller and finally set it as interaction controller for dismiss transition.


We are all set to adjust the dismiss transition with out touch events. Lets manage the animation with the gesture event results:

```
-(void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gesture
{
    CGPoint location = [gesture locationInView:self.viewController.view];
    float delta = (float)(location.x - self.initialPoint.CGPointValue.x) / 150.0 ;
    delta = fabsf(delta);
    
    switch (gesture.state) {
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateBegan:
            
            [self.viewController dismissViewControllerAnimated:YES
                                                    completion:NULL];
            
            self.initialPoint = [NSValue valueWithCGPoint:location];
            break;
            
            .
            .
    }
    .
    .
}

```
* First we get the location in whole screen. At the first touch, we store the location inside `initialPoint`.
* We will start to dismiss the view controller, which triggers the dismiss transition.

--


```
-(void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gesture
{
    .
    .
    
    switch (gesture.state) {
            .
            .
       case UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged:
            
            delta = fmaxf(delta, 0.0);
            delta = fminf(delta, 1.0);
    
            [self updateInteractiveTransition:delta];
            
            break;
            .
            .
    }
    .
    .
}

```

* While moving the touch, `-pan:` method will be called continously, with state `UIGestureRecognizerStateChanged `. we calculated how  much we move our finger on the `x-axis`. While `delta` is guaranteed to be `[0,1]`, we are going to update our transition with the `delta` proportionally.

--


```
-(void)pan:(UIPanGestureRecognizer *)gesture
{
    switch (gesture.state) {
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateEnded:
        case UIGestureRecognizerStateCancelled:
            
            if (gesture.state == UIGestureRecognizerStateCancelled || delta < 0.7) {
                [self cancelInteractiveTransition];
            }
            else
            {
                [self finishInteractiveTransition];
            }
            
            self.initialPoint = nil;
            
            break;
            
        default:
            break;
    }
}

```
* Finally when the gesture ends, we will check the `delta`. In our case, to complete the dismiss transition, we should have move our finger at least %70 of the whole transition. If not the transition is not completed then we call `-cancelInteractiveTransition` method. If we moved the finger enough we will call `-finishInteractiveTransition`.
* Note that the methods `-updateInteractiveTransition:`,`-cancelInteractiveTransition` and `-finishInteractiveTransition` are methods of the protocol `<UIViewControllerInteractiveTransitioning>`. We already have that protocol because we have `UIPercentDrivenInteractiveTransition` as superclass, remember ?

### Here is the result with interaction:

## Summary

We have completed basics of **UIViewControllerTransioning** API. Transitions possibilities are endless with the new API and you can create and attach transitions to different view controllers with no change. Here is the complete source code for the [project][github_project]. Note that the project contains more than the transitions and implementations we discussed here.
